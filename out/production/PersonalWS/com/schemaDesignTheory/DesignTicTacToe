1. Overview of the system
 a. is it real world system b. Do we need to persist data? c.Command line
2. Requirement Gathering
    - Suggest features/ideas or corner cases(classification)
        a. Size of board can be any n*n
        b. Let's says no. of players  = n-1
        c. Every player can choose their symbol at start of the game. We shouldn't allow 2 players with same symbol
3. Will there be bots i.e. computer player? - Yes
4. Bots can have diff. difficulty i.e. simple/medium/complex
5. Only 1 Bot per game?
so we need validation here and which design pattern provide validation(Builder)
5. who will make the fist move? ans is at the start of the game we randomize the list of players and they play in the
order in list
[1,2,3,4]  or [3,2,1,4]
6. How will the winner be decided -> We want to keep our game extensible. User at start of game can list what and all
rules to apply to decide a winner
 ans -> all column of 1 row having same symbol
        all corners have same symbol
        all cells of 1 col having same symbol

  we'll use strategy design pattern as we have different ways to win this game
7. Game ends as soon as one winner or a draw
8. No one can exit in between
9. Undo a move - global undo button, anyone can press any # of times, undo whatever the last move was
10. Show replay of the game once the game ended, doesn't include undone moves
Features to be suggested -> Leader board
                         -> Tournaments
                         -> Pause/Resume/Timer
                         -> Can a player exit a game in between
                         -> Cells are blocked(like in chess)


Surprise question -> how to implement undo feature
